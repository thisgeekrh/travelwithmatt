const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What documents do I need for my cruise?",
    answer: "You'll need a valid passport for most international cruises. For closed-loop cruises (starting and ending in the same US port), a birth certificate and government-issued photo ID may be sufficient. I'll provide specific requirements for your itinerary."
  },
  {
    question: "When is the best time to book a cruise?",
    answer: "Generally, booking 6-12 months in advance offers the best selection and prices. However, last-minute deals can be found 30-90 days before departure. I monitor prices and can help you find the optimal booking window."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need travel insurance?",
    answer: "While not required, travel insurance is highly recommended. It covers trip cancellation, medical emergencies, lost luggage, and other unexpected issues. I can help you find the right coverage for your needs."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the dining options on cruise ships?",
    answer: "Most ships offer main dining rooms, buffets, and specialty restaurants. Many include main dining and buffet meals in your fare, while specialty restaurants typically have additional charges. I can help you understand the dining options for your specific cruise."
  },
  {
    question: "Are there activities for kids on cruise ships?",
    answer: "Yes! Most major cruise lines have excellent kids' clubs and activities for children of all ages. Programs typically start from age 3 and include supervised activities, games, crafts, and age-appropriate entertainment."
  },
  {
    question: "How much should I budget for onboard expenses?",
    answer: "Plan for gratuities ($14-18 per person per day), drinks (if not included), specialty dining, shore excursions, and souvenirs. I can help you estimate costs based on your preferences and the specific cruise line."
  },
  {
    question: "What's included in my cruise fare?",
    answer: "Typically includes your cabin, most meals, entertainment, and use of ship facilities. Not included: gratuities, alcoholic beverages, specialty dining, shore excursions, spa services, and personal expenses."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I bring my own alcohol on board?",
    answer: "Most cruise lines don't allow you to bring your own alcohol. Some allow limited wine or champagne, usually with a corkage fee. I'll provide the specific policy for your chosen cruise line."
  },
  {
    question: "What about internet access on cruise ships?",
    answer: "Most ships offer Wi-Fi packages for purchase. Speeds vary by ship and location. Some premium lines include basic internet. I can help you choose the right package for your needs."
  },
  {
    question: "How do shore excursions work?",
    answer: "You can book excursions through the cruise line (convenient but often more expensive) or independently (more flexibility and often cheaper). I can recommend trusted independent operators and help you plan your port days."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I get seasick?",
    answer: "Modern cruise ships are very stable, and many people never experience seasickness. If you're concerned, book a cabin in the middle of the ship on a lower deck. Over-the-counter medications and wristbands are also effective."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I change or cancel my booking?",
    answer: "Cancellation policies vary by cruise line and fare type. Most offer some flexibility with cancellation fees that increase closer to departure. I'll explain the specific terms for your booking and help you understand your options."
  },
  {
    question: "What should I pack for my cruise?",
    answer: "Pack comfortable clothing, swimwear, formal wear (if your cruise has formal nights), toiletries, medications, and any special items you need. I'll provide a detailed packing list based on your destination and cruise line."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I choose the right cabin?",
    answer: "Consider your budget, preferences for space and views, and sensitivity to motion. Inside cabins are most affordable, oceanview offers natural light, balconies provide private outdoor space, and suites offer maximum luxury."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between cruise lines?",
    answer: "Each line has its own personality and target market. Some focus on families, others on luxury or adventure. I'll help you find the perfect match based on your preferences, budget, and travel style."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I get to the cruise port?",
    answer: "Options include driving and parking, airport transfers, ride-sharing services, or public transportation. I can help you arrange transportation and provide specific directions for your departure port."
  }
